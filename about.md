I’m a Data & BI Analyst aspiring to become a Data Scientist. I enjoy the full 
path from raw data to an answer someone can act on. My focus areas are Python 
(pandas/NumPy), SQL, and Power BI with clean, reproducible workflows.

**What I’m good at**
- Framing questions so dashboards and models answer something concrete.
- Building tidy datasets and defensive SQL that others can extend.
- Turning KPIs into simple visuals and explanations.

**Experience highlights**
- **Business Intelligence Analyst — Quanser Consulting Inc. (Markham, ON).**  
  Built decision-ready dashboards and automations to reduce manual reporting.
- **Salesforce Developer — HIC Global Solutions.**  
  Delivered customizations and integrations across two orgs; cross-team communication.
- **Research Intern — A*STAR (Singapore).**  
  Analyzed lab data, presented concise findings, and documented methods clearly.

**Education & certifications**
- BASc, Digital Technologies (Data Science Stream) — York University  
- BASc, Engineering Science, Business Minor, Certificate in Leadership — University of Toronto  
- Google Data Analytics (Coursera)
